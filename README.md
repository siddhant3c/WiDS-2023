# Classification of MRI images ðŸ§¬

The project focuses on developing a classification model using deep learning techniques to analyze brain MRI images. The dataset that will be used contains four classes. We would make a binary classification model (tumor vs no-tumor predictor), then would go on to build a model capable of multiclass classification.

Data preprocessing techniques will be applied to increase the training dataset's diversity and prevent overfitting. The model architecture would be based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers for binary/multiclass classification. After training the model, its performance will be evaluated on a separate test set, and various evaluation metrics will be calculated.

# Prerequisites
Basic Python Skills and a lot of Enthusiasm to learn about Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

# Tentative Timeline

| Week | Work | 
| :---   | :--- |
| Week 1 | Brush up Python Programming, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib |

# Resources
## Week 1
### Aim
During Week 1, we will review Python programming along with basics of NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. This knowledge will prove valuable when developing models. Note that you are not required to remember all the functions of these libraries, just go through them once.
