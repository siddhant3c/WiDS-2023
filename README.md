# Classification of MRI images 🧬

The project focuses on developing a classification model using deep learning techniques to analyze brain MRI images. The dataset that will be used contains four classes. We would make a binary classification model (tumor vs no-tumor predictor), then would go on to build a model capable of multiclass classification.

Data preprocessing techniques will be applied to increase the training dataset's diversity and prevent overfitting. The model architecture would be based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers for binary/multiclass classification. After training the model, its performance will be evaluated on a separate test set, and various evaluation metrics will be calculated.

# Prerequisites
Basic Python Skills and a lot of Enthusiasm to learn about Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

# Resources
## Week 1
### Aim
During Week 1, we will review Python programming along with basics of NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. This knowledge will prove valuable when developing models. Note that you are not required to remember all the functions of these libraries, just go through them once.

## Week 2
### Aim
Get Acquainted with neural networks and the math behind it. You need not understand every nitty-griity of it, but this shall be your building blocks of deep learning to develop the intuition. You will get to know how to utilize PyTorch.

### Assignment 1 and 2
Find the Assignment 1 [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mdV2FyO0Ket1TX0sxLNAx_zQuqwZCmVF?usp=sharing) <br/>
Dataset for Assignment 2 can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression) <br/>

Some instructions and important points:
* For Assignment 1, Go to the link and copy the file to your drive <br/>
![instruction](https://github.com/siddhant3c/WiDS-2023/assets/119072231/079d25c0-3f4a-4e2b-b78d-1052bc6e9d57)<br/>
* For Assignment 1, Follow the instructions mentioned in the file.
* For Assignment 2, use `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LinearRegression` and `from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error, mean_squared_error`. Use them to make a linear regression model and also for computing evaluation metrics. Train the model on the given dataset, and perform some EDA before model training.
* For both assignments, you need to submit your code (one .ipynb file for each assignment)
* The submission for both assignments would be via a single google form. (Link will be shared soon)
* Deadline is 1st Jan


## Week 3
### Aim
This week is for you to develop an understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Also, we will perform EDA on the dataset, and will pre-process the data to handle class imbalance. Here is what to keep in mind- we want a binary classification model, and thus need only 2 classes. You will need to merge the 3 tumor classes into a single class. Think of various data augmentation techniques you can use to overcome the imbalance.
